# LGSPose: Language-Guided 6D Object Pose Estimation via Scene-Level Semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting
We are currently working on arranging our code to run on the new machine, and the code will be released once the paper enters the review stage.
## Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge the following methods and tools that were instrumental in this project:
- **[3DGS](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting)**: Assistance 3D Gaussian Splatting.
- **[Open-Vocabulary Object 6D Pose Estimation](https://github.com/jcorsetti/oryon)**:This provides us with an idea for proposing such language-guided pose estimation.
- **[GaussReg: Fast 3D Registration with GaussianSplatting](https://github.com/qinzheng93/GeoTransformer)**: Assisted us in achieving the registration of GS and point cloud.
- **[Semantic Gaussians](https://github.com/sharinka0715/semantic-gaussians)**: This provides an idea for our semantic 3DGS. Although we both use semantic information, our methods and ideas are completely different.
We are grateful to the developers and researchers behind these methods and tools for their contributions to the community.
